This plugin provides Gradle-based assembly of system packages, typically for RedHat and Debian based distributions,
using a canonical Gradle Copy Specs. It's structured as three plugins, which work in concert, and a fourth plugin
to pull them all together. Keep reading to see some power examples, follow the links to further pages for the formal
documentation. All the plugins are pure-java and don't require any local native binaries.
